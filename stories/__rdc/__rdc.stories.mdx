# react-digit-components

Welcome to the storybook for react-digit-components! This website hopefully contains all the necessary documentation
needed to develop with react-digit-components.

## What is react-digit-components and why does it exist?

react-digit-components, or RDC, is a collection components which was found useful to reuse in the various projects that
digIT, didIT and other contributors worked on. Here are some of the reasons why react-digit-components exists:

* Reduce code duplication among projects
Often you'll need a Button for your project, why create a new one when it already has been done?

* Share the same style between websites
What if a digIT want to create a new look and feel for all websites? Then just update RDC, and then update the websites
using RDC. If the functionality is the same, then nothing (should) break! Much easier then changing on each and every
website.

* Being able to control the breaking changes
RDC uses a few dependencies such as material-ui/core. Sometimes they and other dependencies make breaking changes. But
instead of fixing those breaking change for each website, just fix it in RDC and bump the minor version for it.

* Centralising and standardizing the documentation for digIT
Instead of building a website using the dependencies that RDC uses where documentation are spread out, why not use
RDC where you'll probably find all the documentation needed to develop your website.

## How do I get started with react-digit-components?

Start of with installing react-digit-components:

`yarn add @cthit/react-digit-components`
or
`npm install @cthit/react-digit-components`

then add required dependencies that can be found under peer dependencies in react-digit-components `package.json`. To
reduces possible bugs, stick the with exact version that are defined in RDC. https://github.com/cthit/react-digit-components/blob/master/package.json

Then, add the following code in your App.jsx:
```jsx
import { DigitProviders, DigitHeader, DigitButton } from "@cthit/react-digit-components"
```

```jsx
<DigitProviders>
    <DigitHeader
        title="My website"
        renderMain={() => (
            <DigitButton text="Hello world!"/>
        )}
    />
</DigitProviders>
```

You should now see a header with a title, along with a button beneath the header. It's worth noting that
`<DigitProviders/>` is an **obligatory** component to wrap your entire app inside of. You now have two options to
continue learning about RDC:

* Start exploring the different components here in this storybook
* Or read how other websites uses RDC, examples can be found above in the table.

## What are future plans for react-digit-components?

The heaviest dependencies used in RDC is material-ui. The long term plan is to remove this completely and instead only
use styled-components. This would be implementing a lot of the logic used in material-ui in RDC: In theory, this should
not be a breaking change for websites using RDC, but it should instead give them capabilities to use the great library
react-digit-components and style all RDC components with ease. Right now customizing the style of components is limited.
