There's a few properties that almost every component has to make it easier to layout and size react-digit-components components. 

## `size`

With the size prop, you can control `width`, `height`, `maxWidth`, `maxHeight`, `minWidth` and `minHeight`. Each prop accepts a string, that can for example be `500px` or `20%`. 

Using the `size` prop can look like this:

```jsx
<DigitButton 
    size={{
        maxWidth: "200px",
        height: "100px"
    }}
/>
```

## `padding` / `margin`

`padding` and `margin` can either take in an object, with the props `left`, `top`, `right` and `bottom`, or it can take in a string to apply the `margin` or `padding` to all sides. 

With that said, using the props can look like this: 

```jsx
<DigitTextField
    padding={{
        left: "50px",
        right: "75px"
    }}
    margin="50px"
/>
```

```jsx
<DigitAutoCompleteSelectSingle 
    padding="50px"
    margin={{
        top: "20%",
        bottom: "15wh"
    }}
/>
```

## `alignSelf` / `justifySelf`

Both `alignSelf` and `justifySelf` can be very powerful in scenarios where flex or grid is used. To read more about the props, google them with either flex or grid, depending on what you're using.

Both props are just string values such as:

```jsx
<DigitSelect 
    alignSelf="center"
    justifySelf="flex-end"
/>
```

## `flex`

`flex` props can be read more about [here](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox). It's very powerful when using `display: flex;`.

`flex` is also just a string value:

```jsx
<DigitTable 
    flex="1"
/>
```

## `gridColumn` / `gridRow`

`display: grid` is awesome! `gridColumn` and `gridRow` are props used to control the position of a given component inside a grid. Both `gridColumn` and `gridRow` takes in an object that has two props: `start` and `end`. You can read more about grids [here](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/).

```jsx
<DigitSwitch 
    gridColumn={{
        start: "1",
        end: "3"
    }}
    gridRow={{
        start: "3",
        end: "span 1"
    }}
/>
```
