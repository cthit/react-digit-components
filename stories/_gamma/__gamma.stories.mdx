<Meta title="Gamma integration"/>

react-digit-components provides some hooks and components to make the integration with Gamma easier for you.

# `useGamma`

This hook automatically syncs with your backend to load the currently signed-in user. Your backend has to implement two post requests to be able to integrate with Gamma. 

* `GET` for the currently signed-in user, default: `/api/me`. Should return either `200`, along with the signed-in user, or `401` along with an URL for the client to redirect to Gamma.

* `POST` to send the code from Gamma, default: `/api/auth`. Your backend will receive the code in an object like this: `{code: "ABCABC"}`. Your backend will have to send this to Gamma to be able to receive an access token. 

Note that you'll need to have cookie-based authentication with your backend. Worth mentioning is that you'll need to fix a proxy so that your frontend and backend are on the same port to make sure that your cookie is set properly. 

By default, `useGamma` will try to redirect the client to Gamma if the user is not signed in. 

Parameters for the hook: 

`useGamma(getMeUrl = "/api/me" : string, postCodeUrl = "/api/auth" : string, redirectAutomatically = true : bool)`

It returns:

`[loading : bool, error : bool, signIn : func]`

The `signIn` function will try to call `GET` and follow that flow. 

# `useGammaMe`

With `useGammaMe`, you can get the signed in user as an object. If the user is not signed in, then `null` is returned.

# `DigitGammaActions`

An easy way to display that a user is signed in. You can read more about it [here](/?path=/docs/others-digitgammaactions--gamma-actions-no-avatar)
