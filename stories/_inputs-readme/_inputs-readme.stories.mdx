# Inputs

Inputs in react-digit-components are quite simple. They all have the properties `value` and `onChange`. They are all uncontrolled, meaning that you have to manage and supply the `value` to the component. But with for example `DigitEditData` and `useDigitFormField` you don't have to do this. Note that when there's multiple values, for example `value` is represented by an array, then it's always some sort of `id` or similar values that should be used. No objects.
