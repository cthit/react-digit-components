# useDigitDialog

A hook that can be used to open a dialog window, `DigitDialog`, that blocks further actions on the website until resolved. `useDigtiDialog` closes automatically when the cancel or confirm buttons is pressed. It is possible to use `DigitDialog` inline, but it's not recommended. A `DigitDialog` has six props that can be viewed at the end of this page. If you need more customization for the dialog, more than just a title and description, then `useDigitCustomDialog` can be used. It's however more complicated.

<Meta title="Hooks/useDigitDialog" />

<Preview>
    <Story name="dialog">
        {() => {
            const [openDialog] = useDigitDialog({
                title: "Oh",
                confirmButtonText: "Confirm",
                cancelButtonText: "Cancel",
                onConfirm: () => console.log("Confirm"),
                onCancel: () => console.log("Cancel")
            });
            return (
                <>
                    <DigitButton raised primary onClick={() => openDialog({description: "Look!"})} text="Open dialog"/>
                </>
            );
        }}
    </Story>

These are the props for the object given as the first and only argument in the hook `useDigitDialog`. `useDigitDialog` returns an array with one function called `openDialog`. It takes in the same object as the hook does, but overrides if there's any conflicts between the two objects.
