# useDigitDialog

A hook that can be used to open a dialog window, `DigitDialog`, that blocks further actions on the website until resolved. `useDigtiDialog` closes automatically when the cancel or confirm buttons is pressed. It is possible to use `DigitDialog` inline, but it's not recommended. A `DigitDialog` has six props that can be viewed at the end of this page. If you need more customization for the dialog, more than just a title and description, then `useDigitCustomDialog` can be used. It's however more complicated.

<Meta title="Dialog/useDigitDialog" />

<Canvas>
    <Story name="dialog">
        {() => {
            const [openDialog] = useDigitDialog({
                title: "Oh",
                confirmButtonText: "Confirm",
                cancelButtonText: "Cancel",
                onConfirm: () => console.log("Confirm"),
                onCancel: () => console.log("Cancel")
            });
            return (
                <React.Fragment>
                    <DigitButton
                        raised
                        primary
                        onClick={() => openDialog({ description: "Look!" })}
                        text="Open dialog"
                    />
                </React.Fragment>
            );
        }}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

## Props

These are the props for the object given as the first and only argument in the hook `useDigitDialog`. `useDigitDialog` returns an array with one function called `openDialog`. It takes in the same object as the hook does, but overrides if there's any conflicts between the two objects.

| **Name**              | **Type**   | **Description**                             |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **title**             | _string_   | The title text in bold of the dialog        |
| **description**       | _string_   | The description text of the dialog          |
| **confirmButtonText** | _string_   | The text for the confirm button             |
| **cancelButtonText**  | _string_   | The text for the cancel button              |
| **onConfirm**         | _function_ | Called when confirm button has been clicked |
| **onCancel**          | _function_ | Called when cancel button has been clicked  |
