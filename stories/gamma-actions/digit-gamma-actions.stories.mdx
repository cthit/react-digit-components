# DigitGammaActions
An easy way of displaying the signed in user aswell as actions to view the users profile in gamma as well as signing out. This should be placed in `DigitHeader` on the right for consistency.

Please note that `nick` and `avatarUrl` can't be controlled with `DigitGammaActions`, but can instead be used with `DigitGammaActionsDummy` if you haven't integrated with gamma but still want the look and feel. When you're actually using `DigitGammaActions`, you don't need to give any props. Note that though it assumes that `useGamma` is used and has been set up.

<Preview>
    <Story name="gamma actions no avatar">
        <DigitGammaActionsDummy nick="Sven"/>

    <Story name="gamma actions avatar">
        <DigitGammaActionsDummy nick="Portals" avatarUrl="https://i.imgur.com/RWTnpiq.gif"/>
