# useDigitToast

A easy way of showing a small text of information after a user action, such as a deletion or creation. It also provides a way to add a button to this toast such as a undo button. `useDigitToast` has a built in queue, meaning you can spam away the toast messages.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Standard">
        {() => {
            const [queueToast] = useDigitToast({
                duration: 3000,
                actionText: "hej",
                actionHandler: () => {}
            });
            return (
                <DigitButton
                    text="Queue toast"
                    raised
                    primary
                    onClick={() =>
                        queueToast({
                            text: "Hej: " + new Date().getTime() / 24
                        })
                    }
                />
            );
        }}
    </Story>
